        <h2>Fly Fishing Company Database Project</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, I worked as part of a team to develop a comprehensive database solution for a fly fishing company.
            Our goal was to design and implement a fully operational database system that streamlined various business processes,
            including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Purchase orders</li>
            <li>Shipping and receiving</li>
            <li>Manufacturing</li>
            <li>Budgeting and cost management</li>
            <li>Inventory and quantity tracking</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            As part of the project, we created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to map out the database structure and relationships
            between entities. We also developed all the backend string connections to ensure smooth integration and functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
            This database solution helped the company improve operational efficiency by centralizing and automating data management
            across multiple departments. It was a rewarding experience that honed my skills in database design, problem-solving,
            and teamwork.
